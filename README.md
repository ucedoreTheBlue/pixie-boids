# pixie-boids
Boids are a word used originally by Craig Reynolds in his paper on the behaviours of flocks, herds and schools. The aim with boids is to make them behave like a flock of birds in real life. This can be done by making them follow three fundamental rules:

1- separation:
the boids must avoid hitting each other

2- alignment: 
the boids must fly in the same direction

3- cohesion:
the boids must aim to be at the center of the flock.
